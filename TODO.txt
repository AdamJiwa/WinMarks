figure out what the deal with the stdafx.h is

Typically Windows should generate the resource.h from the .rc file however
because it can't find the name of the variable it treats them as strings. It
also seems like windows wont auto generate the header file until the file has
been saved through visual studio using a macro. There is probably a way to 
interact with the macro directly as a step in cmake but no one seems to be
doing it.

There is also the mingw tool windres but that seems odd and out of the cmake 
scope aswell.

It seems strange that I need to define the name of the rc variables multiple
times. It seems to do with namespacing for multiple .rc files. other cmake
repositories seem to have had visual studio generate the header and then keep
it committed.

There is a mention of the issue here
